## Student Accommodation

The ACL Office will accept your reservation request and make the reservations on your behalf.  Room sharing is recommended since only a limited number of rooms are available at the discounted rates. If you would like to share, you will need to specify the total number of people who will be sharing the room including yourself (i.e., yourself plus 1 to 3 others). Please be aware that rooms typically come with two beds so any more than two people may have to share a bed.

Please complete [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/hx5qKruufwnU9xro2) to make your reservation request.  We will do our best to honor your preferred hotel from the list below on a first-come first served basis.  All requests must be received **no later than Thursday, June 1, 2017** by the ACL Office.

The Georgian Court Hotel and YWCA Hotel are conveniently located in the same block, which makes it easier to share costs when traveling to the Conference Hotel if you do not care to walk. These hotels are about 2.09km (1.3 miles) &mdash; a 15-20 minute walk &mdash; from the Conference Hotel.
