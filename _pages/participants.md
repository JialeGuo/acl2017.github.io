## About Vancouver

From June &mdash; August, temperatures are generally warm, ranging from 20-28&deg;C (approximately 78-90&deg;F). Lots of sunshine can be expected. Daylight hours are approximately 6:00 am – 9:00 pm. Currently (as of March 19th), one Canadian dollar (CAD) is equal to .70€ or $0.75.

### Conference Venue

ACL 2017 will be held from July 30th through August 4th, 2017 at the Westin Bayshore Hotel in downtown Vancouver:
<pre>
1601 Bayshore Drive
Vancouver, BC V6G 2V4
Tel:  +1-604-682-3377
<a href="http://www.westinbayshore.com/">http://www.westinbayshore.com/</a>

All parts of the conference will take place at the Westin Bayshore Hotel on the first and second floors.  Precise room assignments will be made closer to the conference.

### Things to Do &amp; See

Enjoy views of the coastline, distant mountains, and Stanley Park, plus easy access to all of the best things to do in Vancouver.  Boasting one of the most spectacular coastal locations in the world, the snowcapped mountains and the Pacific Ocean come together to create a truly magnificent setting. In addition, you are moments from shopping at Robson Street and Pacific Centre Mall, and attractions like the Vancouver Aquarium and Granville Island. Find even more things to do in Vancouver at <a href="http://www.tourismvancouver.com">www.tourismvancouver.com</a> or visit the hotel's website.

## Presenter Information

### Oral Presentations

Due to the overwhelming number of high quality papers, we have needed
to shorten oral presentation timings.

Long paper talks are given 14 minutes plus 4 minutes for questions
Short papers are given 10 minutes plus 2 minutes for questions
The session chairs will moderate the sessions and ensure timing is
adhered to.  Papers are spaced apart with a 1 minute interval to
provide some time for transitioning between presenters.

### Posters

We are using the same provider as in previous years (e.g., at NAACL 2016).

Poster boards are 4 by 8 feet (121 x 242 cm) in size, and they can
accommodate 2' x 3' or A0 sized posters in both landscape and portrait
formats, or 4'x6' in landscape format.

The extra space on the side of the poster is intended for the audience
to listen to the poster presenter).  There will be one poster per side
of the board.  Posters are likely to be arranged by subject area, so
presenters may be co-located near other posters on similar topics.

## Conference App

This year, we are also experimenting with building a smartphone guide for the conference using the [GuideBook](http://www.guidebook.com) platform. The guide is designed to be an attendee's companion during the conference. Although the guide presents some of the same information on the website, its primary advantage is that, once downloaded, it can be used without an internet connection. It also has the following additional features: 

- A "Schedule" section which shows all of the sessions. 
- "Papers" and "Posters" section which lists all of the papers/posters along with their abstracts.
- An "Authors" section which lists all of presenting authors.
- All of the above sections are searchable and, most importantly, they are all linked appropriately. That is, if you click on a paper session, it shows you all of the papers that will be presented in that session. If you click on a paper, it shows you the session it will be presented in and its authors. And if you click on an author, it shows you all of their papers. 
- A "Floorplan" section showing the conference floor plan.
- A "My Schedule" section to which you can add sessions you want to attend. **Note**: Unfortunately, GuideBook doesn't allow individual papers to be selected. This is a clear disadvantage of the guide compared to the ACL website which --- for the first time -- allows users to generate and print their own [custom schedules](/program) down to individual papers and posters!
- A "My Notes" section where users can jot down notes on any paper/session etc.
- A "My To-Do" section where users can add to-do action items on any paper/session etc.
- Social sections showing all tweets with the hashtag #acl2017nlp and from the official twitter account [@acl2017](http://twitter.com/acl2017), and a communal photo album.

To use the guide, you need to [download the GuideBook app](https://guidebook.com/g/acl2017nlp/) first and then download the "ACL 2017" guide from within that app. If you already have the GuideBook app installed on your smartphone, you can simply scan the QR code below to download the ACL 2017 guide.

## Student Accommodation
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-size: larger; border: 2px solid red; padding: 3px;">EVERYTHING SOLD OUT</span>

We also have booked a small number of rooms specifically for students at super-discounted rates:  [Westin Bayshore Vancouver](#westin-bayshore-vancouver-1) (the conference hotel, with 10 rooms), the [Georgian Court Hotel](#georgian-court-hotel) (with 20 rooms), and the [YWCA Hotel](#ywca-hotel) (with 20 rooms).  To the extent possible, we encourage students to share rooms.

The ACL Office will accept your reservation request and make the reservations on your behalf.  Room sharing is recommended since only a limited number of rooms are available at the discounted rates. If you would like to share, you will need to specify the total number of people who will be sharing the room including yourself (i.e., yourself plus 1 to 3 others). Please be aware that rooms typically come with two beds so any more than two people may have to share a bed.

Please complete <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">this form</span> (<span style="color: red;">SOLD OUT</span>) to make your reservation request.  We will do our best to honor your preferred hotel from the list below on a first-come first served basis.  All requests must be received **no later than Thursday, June 1, 2017** by the ACL Office.

The Georgian Court Hotel and YWCA Hotel are conveniently located in the same block, which makes it easier to share costs when traveling to the Conference Hotel if you do not care to walk. These hotels are about 2.09km (1.3 miles) &mdash; a 15-20 minute walk &mdash; from the Conference Hotel.

## On-site Childcare

For the first time ever, ACL will be offering on-site childcare at the conference hotel.  We have hired a professional childcare service, KiddieCorp, which has experience providing childcare at conventions.  Childcare will be available from 9 AM until 5 PM on the tutorial and workshop days, and from 8 AM until 6 PM during the main conference.  The childcare room will be located close to the conference rooms, and has space for up to 23 children.  We will also have a room available for nursing, or for mothers who need to pump.

The cost of the childcare is partially subsidized by the ACL.  The cost for general registrants will be $10.00 USD per hour per child.   For students registrants the cost will be $5.00 USD per hour per child. Availability is limited, so we encourage you to sign up soon.  The childcare registration is being handled by  KiddieCorp.  For more information, and to sign up for childcare services, please use [this form](https://form.jotform.com/KiddieCorp/ACLKids).
