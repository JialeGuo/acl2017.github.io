<span style="font-weight: bolder;font-size: larger;">Call For Papers</span>

The ACL 2017 conference invites the submission of long and short papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of automated language processing. As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the [Transactions of the ACL](http://www.transacl.org/) journal.

ACL 2017 has the goal of a broad technical program. Relevant topics
for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following
areas (in alphabetical order):

- Cognitive modeling and psycholinguistics
- Dialog and interactive systems
- Discourse and pragmatics
- Document analysis including text categorization, topic models, and retrieval
- Generation
- Information extraction and general NLP applications including but not limited to text mining, question answering, document analysis, text categorization, topic models, retrieval, and grammatical error correction
- Machine learning
- Machine translation
- Multilinguality
- Phonology, morphology, and word segmentation
- Resources and evaluation
- Semantics
- Sentiment analysis and opinion mining
- Social media
- Speech
- Summarization
- Tagging, chunking, syntax, and parsing
- Vision, robots, and other grounding

## Submissions

### Long Papers

Long ACL 2017 submissions must describe substantial, original,
completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete
evaluation and analysis should be included. Review forms will be
made available prior to the deadlines.

Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus
unlimited references; final versions of long papers will be given
one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers'
comments can be taken into account.

Long papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by
the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be
presented orally and which as poster presentations will be based on
the nature rather than the quality of the work. There will be no
distinction in the proceedings between long papers presented orally
and as posters.

### Short Papers

ACL 2017 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions must
describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short
paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should
have a point that can be made in a few pages. Some kinds of short
papers are:

- A small, focused contribution
- Work in progress
- A negative result
- An opinion piece
- An interesting application nugget

Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus
unlimited references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given
five (5) content pages in the proceedings. Authors are encouraged to
use this additional page to address reviewers comments in their
final versions.

Short papers will be presented in one or more oral or poster
sessions. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers
in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings
between short papers presented orally and as posters.

## General Notes

Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents that are
not available to the reviewers. Papers may be accompanied by a
resource (software and/or data) described in the paper. Papers that
are submitted with accompanying software/data may receive additional
credit toward the overall evaluation score, and the potential impact
of the software and data will be taken into account when making the
acceptance/rejection decisions.

ACL 2017 also encourages the submission of supplementary material to
report preprocessing decisions, model parameters, and other details
necessary for the replication of the experiments reported in the
paper. Seemingly small preprocessing decisions can sometimes make a
large difference in performance, so it is crucial to record such
decisions to precisely characterize state-of-the-art methods.

Nonetheless, supplementary material should be supplementary (rather
than central) to the paper. It may include explanations or details
of proofs or derivations that do not fit into the paper, lists of
features or feature templates, sample inputs and outputs for a
system, pseudo-code or source code, and data. The paper should not
rely on the supplementary material: while the paper may refer to and
cite the supplementary material and the supplementary material will
be available to reviewers, they will not be asked to review or even
download the supplementary material. Authors should refer to the
contents of the supplementary material in the paper submission, so
that reviewers interested in these supplementary details will know
where to look.

As the reviewing will be blind, papers must not include authors'
names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
author's identity, e.g., _"We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."_
must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as _"Smith previously
showed (Smith, 1991) ..."_ Papers that do not conform to these
requirements will be rejected without review.

### Paper Submission and Templates

Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference
management system at:

- [https://www.softconf.com/acl2017/papers](https://www.softconf.com/acl2017/papers) &ndash; for long papers

- [https://www.softconf.com/acl2017/shortpapers](https://www.softconf.com/acl2017/shortpapers) &ndash; for short papers

Long paper submissions must follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings without exceeding eight (8) pages of content. Short paper submissions must also follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings, and must not exceed four (4) pages. References do not count against these limits. We strongly recommend the use of the official ACL 2017 style templates: 

 - [LaTeX](/downloads/acl17-latex.zip) 
 - [Microsoft Word](/downloads/acl17-word.zip)

All submissions must in PDF format and must conform to the official style guidelines, which are contained in these template files.

###  Multiple Submission Policy

Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time in an author-blinded cover page, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted by ACL 2017. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at ACL 2017 must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be presented. We will not accept for publication or presentation papers that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.

Preprint servers such as [arXiv.org](http://arXiv.org) and workshops that do not have published proceedings are not considered archival for purposes of submission. Authors must state in the online submission form the name of the workshop or preprint server and title of the non-archival version. The version submitted for review should be suitably anonymized and not contain references to the prior non-archival version. Reviewers will be told: "The author(s) have notified us that there exists a non-archival previous version of this paper with significantly overlapping text. We have approved submission under these circumstances, but to preserve the spirit of blind review, the current submission does not reference the non-archival version." Reviewers are free to do what they like with this information.

Authors submitting more than one paper to ACL 2017 must ensure that
submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other in
content or results.

### Presentation Requirement

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in
the proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must
register for ACL 2017 by the early registration deadline.
