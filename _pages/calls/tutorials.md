<span style="font-weight: bolder;font-size: larger;">Joint Call for Tutorial Proposals: EACL/ACL/EMNLP 2017</span>

The European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL), the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), and the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) invite
proposals for tutorials to be held in conjunction with EACL 2017, ACL 2017, or EMNLP 2017. We  seek proposals for tutorials in all areas of computational linguistics (CL), broadly conceived to include disciplines such as Linguistics,
Speech, Information Retrieval, Psycholinguistics, and Multimodal Processing.

We particularly welcome:

1. Tutorials which cover advances in newly emerging areas not previously covered in an *ACL related tutorial.
2. Tutorials which provide introduction to related fields which are relevant for the CL community (e.g. bioinformatics, neuroscience, human language processing, video and image analysis, machine learning techniques).

In order to gather a widespread audience, the experience and qualifications of the instructors will also be taken into account.

- [EACL 2017](http://eacl2017.org/index.php/tutorials) is the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, to be held in Valencia, Spain, 3-7 April 2017. The selected tutorials will be given on the Monday and Tuesday preceding the main conference (3-4 April). 
- [ACL 2017](http://acl2017.org/tutorials) is the 55th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and will take place in Vancouver, Canada, from July 30th through August 4th, 2017. The selected tutorials will be given on 30th July. 
- EMNLP 2017  is planned for Copenhagen on the 4-6 September 2017. The tutorials will be given on the 3 September. 

## Remuneration

Remuneration for tutorials is regulated by ACL policies . Please note that remuneration for tutorial presenters is fixed according to the above policy and does not cover registration fees for the main conference.

## Submission Details

Proposals for tutorials should contain:
   
1. A title and brief description of the tutorial content and its relevance to the CL community (not more than 2 pages).
2. A brief outline of the tutorial structure showing that the tutorial's core content can be covered in a three-hour slot (excluding a coffee break). In exceptional cases six-hour tutorial slots can be arranged.
3. The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of the tutorial instructors, including a one-paragraph statement of their research interests and areas of expertise.
4. A list of previous venues and approximate audience sizes, if the same or a similar tutorial has been given elsewhere; otherwise an estimate of the audience size.
5. A description of special requirements for technical equipment (e.g. internet access).
6. A note specifying which venue(s) (EACL/ACL/EMNLP) would be acceptable and/or preferable.

Tutorial proposals should be submitted online by November 30, 2016 through the [START system](https://www.softconf.com/g/acl-tutorials2017/). Proposals will be reviewed jointly by the Tutorial Co-Chairs of the three conferences.

## Tutorial Speaker Responsibilities

Accepted tutorial speakers will be notified by December 30, 2016, and must then provide descriptions of their tutorials for inclusion in the conference registration material by January 30, 2017. The description should be in two formats:  (a) an ASCII version that can be included in email announcements and published on the conference web site, and a (b) PDF version for inclusion in the electronic proceedings (detailed instructions to follow).
