We plan to open conference registration in mid-May.  Here are some details to help you plan your trip in advance.

## Important Dates

<table style="width: 70%; font-size: medium;">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Early online registration ends</td>
            <td>Friday</td>
            <td>June 9, 2017 11:59 PM EDT</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Late online registration ends</td>
            <td>Friday</td> 
            <td>July 14, 2017 11:59 PM EDT</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>On-site registration opens</td>
            <td>Thursday</td>
            <td>July 30, 2017</td>

Please note that:

- Registration prices will increase starting Saturday, June 10th, 2017 once early online registration has ended. 
- After the July 14th deadline for late online registration, you can *only* register on-site at the conference venue starting July 30th, 2017.

## What's included

As in previous years, your conference registration includes the main conference sessions, poster sessions, and demonstration sessions. Workshops and tutorials are not included. Also included are a Welcome Reception Sunday evening, breakfasts, mid-morning and mid-afternoon coffee breaks each day, and full dinners at both of the poster/demo sessions on Monday and Tuesday evenings.  

Be sure to plan to attend the [Social Event](/participants#social-event), an evening of desserts, beverages and music to take place Tuesday, August 1st, following the poster session, at the Vancouver Aquarium following the Tuesday evening poster session (also included)! 

## Estimated Fees

We expect registration fees to be similar to those at ACL 2016, although the fees have not yet been set and may increase somewhat.  Below are the fees (in USD) charged for ACL 2016 that may be used as an approximation for planning your travel budget.
