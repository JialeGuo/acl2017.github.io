<p>*SEM brings together researchers interested in the semantics of natural languages and its computational modeling. The conference embraces symbolic and probabilistic approaches, and everything in between; theoretical contributions as well as practical applications are welcome in the form of long and short papers. The long-term goal of *SEM is to provide a stable forum for the growing number of NLP researchers working on all aspects of semantics.</p>

### Thursday, August 3, 2017

<br/>
<a href="https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2017/" class="btn btn--inverse btn--small">W5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;[BUCC: 10th Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora](https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2017/)

<p>Comparable corpora are useful not just as training data for statistical NLP applications, e.g., statistical machine translation or cross-lingual retrieval but also because they make possible intra-linguistic discoveries and comparisons. This workshop brings together bring together builders and users of comparable compora.</p>

<a href="http://clpsych.org" class="btn btn--inverse btn--small">W6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;[CLPsych: Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology – From  Linguistic Signal to Clinical Reality](http://clpsych.org)

<p>Past CLPsych workshops have proposed methods for aiding diagnoses of dementia, quantifying repetitive behavior in conversations of autistic children, and detecting mental health disorders in social media, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and schizophrenia. CLPsych 2017 aims to continue the discussion and build the momentum towards releasing tools and data that can be used by mental and neurological healthcare professionals.</p>

<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nlpandcss/nlp-css-at-acl-2017" class="btn btn--inverse btn--small">W7</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;[NLP+CSS: Workshops on Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science](https://sites.google.com/site/nlpandcss/nlp-css-at-acl-2017)

<p>Language is perhaps the most salient outcome of complex social processes. We do not expect teenagers to speak like senior citizens, and we recognize the mutual dependency between language and social factors. Although this interdependence is at the core of models in NLP and (computational) social sciences (CSS), these two fields still exist largely in parallel, holding back research insights and potential applications.  This workshop aims to advance the joint computational analysis of social sciences and language by explicitly involving social scientists, NLP researchers, and industry partners.</p>

<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/repl4nlp2017/" class="btn btn--inverse btn--small">W8</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;[Repl4NLP: 2nd Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP](https://sites.google.com/site/repl4nlp2017/)

<p>The 2nd Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP aims to continue the success of the 1st Workshop which focused on vector space models of meaning, compositionality, and the application of deep neural networks and spectral methods to NLP. It provides a forum for discussing recent advances on these topics, as well as future research directions in linguistically motivated vector-based models in NLP.</p>

<a href="https://robonlp2017.github.io" class="btn btn--inverse btn--small">W9</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;[RoboNLP: Language Grounding for Robotics](https://robonlp2017.github.io)

<p>The embodied, task-oriented aspect of language grounding is an important and timely research direction following the exciting recent progress in visual language grounding. To realize the long-term goal of robots that we can converse with, it is essential that we develop new techniques for linking language to action in the real world. This workshop aims to bring together members of the NLP, robotics, and vision communities to focus on the much-needed task-oriented aspect of language grounding. </p>

<p>The workshops in the TextGraphs series have published and promoted the synergy between the field of Graph Theory and Natural Language Processing. The eleventh edition of the TextGraphs workshop aims to extend the focus on issues and solutions for large-scale graphs, such as those derived for web-scale knowledge acquisition or social networks. </p>

<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/abusivelanguageworkshop2017/" class="btn btn--inverse btn--small">W11</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;[ALW1: 1st Workshop on Abusive Language Online](https://sites.google.com/site/abusivelanguageworkshop2017/)

<p>The last few years have seen a surge in abusive online behavior, with governments, social media platforms, and individuals struggling to cope with the consequences and to produce effective methods to combat it. In this one-day workshop, we bring researchers of various disciplines together to discuss approaches to abusive language. The workshop will include invited speakers and panelists from fields within and outside of NLP, as well as submitted papers from researchers across all areas. In addition, the workshop will host an “unshared task”.</p>

<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/eventsandstoriesinthenews/" class="btn btn--inverse btn--small">W13</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;[EventStory: Events and Stories in the News](https://sites.google.com/site/eventsandstoriesinthenews/)

<p>Following the success of previous Computing News Storylines and EVENTS workhsops, and the strong connections between these two initiatives, the organisers of the two series have decided to join efforts and propose this new workshop: Events and Stories in the News. Connecting these two series is of great importance for both fields of work; it can bring complementary solutions to pending issues concerning the representation and evaluation of storylines, events occurring in complex mentions, event coreference, event structure, event relations and scripts from which different research communities can benefit.</p>

<a href="https://sighum.wordpress.com/events/latech-clfl-2017/" class="btn btn--small btn--inverse btn--small">W14</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;[LaTeCH-CLfL: Joint SIGHUM Workshop on Computational Linguistics for Cultural Heritage, Social Sciences, Humanities and Literature](https://sighum.wordpress.com/events/latech-clfl-2017/)

<p>LaTeCH-CLfL 2017 will put in the same room two events with a similar research focus and with some tradition: the Workshops on Language Technology for Cultural Heritage, Social Sciences, and Humanities (LaTeCH) and the Workshops on Computational Linguistics for Literature (CLfL). The LaTeCH workshop series has focused on developing technologies for improved information access to data from the humanities and social sciences and the CLfL workshops have focussed on applications of NLP to literary data. This joint event will bring both research communities. </p>

<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/acl17nmt/" class="btn btn--inverse btn--small">W15</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;[NMT: 1st Workshop on Neural Machine Translation](https://sites.google.com/site/acl17nmt/)

<p>Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a simple new architecture for getting machines to learn to translate. Despite being relatively recent, NMT has demonstrated promising results and attracted much interest, achieving state-of-the-art results on a number of shared tasks. This workshop aims to cultivate research in neural machine translation and other aspects of machine translation and multilinguality that utilize neural models.</p>
